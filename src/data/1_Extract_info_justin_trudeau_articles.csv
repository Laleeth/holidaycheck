Trudeau harnessed it for his route to power, only to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/jun/12/justin-trudeau-deploys-the-politics-of-hype-jeremy-corbyn-offers-politics-of-hope"">betray</a> it in office. The environmental Adonis <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/17/stop-swooning-justin-trudeau-man-disaster-planet"">transformed</a> into an oil barons’ salesman. An electoral reform promise was broken with a shrug. Instead of a peace offensive, we’ve gotten a military <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/07/19/flexing-military-might-shows-trudeau-not-a-us-lapdog-mcquaig.html"">spending</a> spree; instead of novel social programs, novelty socks. </p> <p>The agenda the NDP began unveiling this weekend, however, needs to become a whole lot bolder. Expanding healthcare to cover drugs and dental-care, stopping pension theft and new privatizations, closing tax loopholes, and building affordable housing: this is an end to the disastrous right-wing slide of past NDP leaders, but it’s not nearly ambitious enough. For years they’ve seemed to believe success depended on becoming indistinguishable from centrist, corporate-friendly Liberals: the point now is to become demonstrably different.<br></p> <p>One problem is that the Liberals can claim they are already pursuing many of these policies – or, as in the case of pharma-care, that it may soon be in their platform. But the main problem is this: it doesn’t truly break with the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot"">neoliberal economic consensus</a> in Canada that has devastated peoples’ lives and turned so many off politics. </p> <p>Massive tax cuts for the rich, deregulation, privatization, corporate trade deals, and more money for prisons and police: this elite agenda has dominated for nearly four decades. It is why two billionaires <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oxfam-davos-report-canadians-wealth-1.3937073"">own</a> as much as wealth as the bottom third; why wages for a majority have not <a href=""https://globalnews.ca/news/3531614/average-hourly-wage-canada-stagnant/"">budged</a>; why corporations have been unshackled to treat the atmosphere like a sewage dump. And yet the population seems more <a href=""http://www.ekospolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/understanding_the_middle_class_final_report.pdf"">clued</a> in than any of the political parties: “Trickle-down economics has been laid bare as a cruel hoax, in the view of many Canadians.” That’s not a line from an issue of the Socialist Worker but from mainstream pollsters.</p> <p>None of neoliberalism’s consequences is more insidious than the structural timidity it has entrenched. As the state’s capacity for positive intervention has been shrunk, political parties have withdrawn from proposing solutions that match the scale our crises. Policy has been eclipsed by a fixation on personality.<br></p> <p>It is folly to think Singh can succeed by playing into this trend, rather than bucking it. Dapper suits, boasts about boxing or wrestling skills, hopey slogans, making a show of public access to candid private moments: all of these are already found in Justin Trudeau’s playbook. And while the discrimination Singh has faced is vital to share to show the need to combat racism in Canada, his individual story can’t become a stand-in for a collective vision: he has to be a pitchman, not the product.<br> </p> <p>What is firing people up around the world are not flashy personalities but far-reaching policies. It’s a good start that Singh has rejected balanced budgets – a destructive <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/14/the-fatal-flaw-of-neoliberalism-its-bad-economics"">neoliberal mantra</a> that has transfixed the NDP for a generation, and allowed them to be out-flanked by Trudeau. So too is the refreshing fact that Singh has begun <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/singh-says-taxes-are-an-investment-in-the-future/article38018829/"">arguing</a> the case for taxation. A bold and transformative agenda funded by taxes and historic government spending, as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated in the UK, is not a risk in elections. It is a sure-fire recipe for success. </p> <p> A dramatic challenge to neoliberalism would be just as popular in Canada. The NDP could propose not merely to close tax loopholes, but to hike the rates paid by the corporations and ultra-rich – which haven’t been lower since WW2. To expand healthcare, but also create new public services: free tuition, universal childcare, and a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2016/mar/09/canadas-post-office-is-getting-a-revolutionary-green-make-over"">public bank</a> to supplant the predatory loansharks. To defend our deteriorating public infrastructure, and to move to publicly own other sectors: energy, railways, or telecoms providers. To go beyond symbolic support for reconciliation to amplify concrete Indigenous demands for land restitution.</p> <p> And it is not the moment to <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/singh-pipeline-bc-alberta-trans-mountain-1.4540543"">address</a> the crisis of climate change with prevarication and platitude. That is already the method of the governing Liberals. People are ready to vote for a clean and cooperative economy that unleashes good-paying jobs in renewable energy instead of stop-gaping an oil industry that is on the way out.</p> <p>The surest way to tell that a NDP agenda could massively lift ordinary people’s prospects and electrify the public? A backlash from the media and political class. As organizers from the Corbyn and Bernie Sanders campaigns <a href=""http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/new-democrats-hear-leap-manifesto-push-on-eve-of-convention"">shared</a> on the outskirts of the convention, backlashes only underlined their anti-establishment bonafides. The elite aren’t too worried, going by their current response: a murmur of self-serving approval for Singh’s plans. The NDP has yet to realize that the howls of out-of-touch pundits would not be a mark of its failure but a guarantee of its promise.</p> <p> It’s also how the party could inspire people to go door-knocking for it across the country. What was on display at the Ottawa convention - while larger, younger and more diverse than ever - was a party still bent on controlling and managing the energy of its grassroots, rather than empowering and channeling it. Widely-supported resolutions on free tuition and more democratic decision-making were resisted and could end up ignored; another on Palestinian rights was <a href=""https://ricochet.media/en/2130/palestine-resolution-narrowly-stopped-from-hitting-ndp-convention-floor"">stifled</a> completely. There was a similar dynamic when members voted in 2016 to study and engage with the <a href=""http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/new-democrats-hear-leap-manifesto-push-on-eve-of-convention"">Leap Manifesto</a>: it generated a flood of enthusiasm and revived interest in the party, before it was buried by the establishment. The vibrancy of a new generation of activists should not be squandered. </p> <p>If the NDP wants to revive their chances, becoming a less timid version of Justin Trudeau won’t cut it. They can’t hem and haw within Canada’s neoliberal consensus – they have to overthrow it.</p> <p>Twitter: <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/Martin_Lukacs"">@Martin_Lukacs</a></p>'}",False,pillar/news,News

Yet at exactly the same time we are arming one of the most repressive regimes on the planet for women,” said Jaramillo. “So I think there’s a clear gap between the rhetoric and the action of the Canadian government.”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/31/saudi-arabia-violence-canada-armored-trucks-justin-trudeau"">Saudi Arabia reportedly using Canadian military trucks against its own civilians</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The deal <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/31/saudi-arabia-violence-canada-armored-trucks-justin-trudeau"">came under renewed scrutiny last summer,</a> after videos and photos posted on social media allegedly showed Riyadh using Canadian-made equipment in a violent crackdown on minority Shia dissidents in eastern Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>After launching an investigation, Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland,<a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2018/02/speech_by_the_honourablechrystiafreelandministerofforeignaffairs.html?wbdisable=true""> said in February that no conclusive evidence</a> had been found to suggest that vehicles made in Canada were being used to violate human rights in the kingdom.

This sentiment has largely been echoed within Canada, where commentators have variously gushed about the return of progressive government, or warned about the <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/02/21/justin-trudeaus-hamburg-speech-hints-at-populist-shift-in-ottawa.html"">impending injection</a> of “populism” into the Liberal agenda.</p> <p>Despite such bluster, though, Trudeau’s carefully choreographed crusade against inequality has always been more affectation than reality. Consider the disjuncture between Trudeau’s rhetoric and his actions.</p> <p>In 2015, the Liberals <a href=""http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trudeaus-plan-to-tax-rich-and-give-to-middle-class-will-cost-canadians-1-4-billion"">promised</a> to raise taxes on “the wealthiest 1% while cutting them for the middle class”. The pledge sounds attractive enough in principle, but <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economic-insight/trudeaus-promised-middle-class-tax-cut-excludes-most-canadians/article27215398/"">in practice</a> amounted to a small tax increase for top earners and a corresponding tax cut, the major gains of which went to people making between $89,200 and $200,000 a year. With a <a href=""https://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/170913/dq170913a-eng.htm"">median family income in 2015</a> of $70,336, the beneficiaries are not exactly Canada’s “middle class”, let alone its working poor.</p> <p>Some of the country’s wealthiest corporate executives, meanwhile, got to keep a <a href=""http://pressprogress.ca/bay_street_pressured_liberals_to_break_promise_to_close_ceo_tax_loophole_documents_show/"">lucrative tax loophole</a> allowing them to pay a 50% lower rate on compensation earned through stock options – despite the Liberal campaign <a href=""http://www.liberal.ca/files/2011/04/liberal_platform.pdf"">pledge</a> to cap it.</p> <p>His embrace of Keynesian economics has been equally ethereal. In 2015, apparently rebelling against the prevailing economic orthodoxy of austerity, the Liberal leader pledged to stimulate the economy through modest, deficit-financed social investment. </p> <p>Upon implementation, however, some $15bn was channelled into an “infrastructure bank”, geared to attract private financing. The <a href=""http://www.broadbentinstitute.ca/privatization_of_public_infrastructure"">promises</a> of “socially useful, non-commercial projects like childcare or affordable housing to cash-strapped cities” will take a back seat to those with <a href=""http://pressprogress.ca/liberals_redirect_15b_to_infrastructure_projects_that_generate_revenue_for_private_investors/"">“revenue-generating potential”</a>.

Jeremy Corbyn offers politics of hope | Martin Lukacs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trudeau has also remained ambivalent towards the kind of big programs that could actually redistribute wealth in a meaningful way. On childcare, for example, he favours a <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-says-child-care-benefit-should-not-go-to-rich-families-like-his/article25624594/"">means-tested</a> approach, rather than the universal, public provision of a desperately needed service. And in a <a href=""http://pressprogress.ca/justin_trudeau_told_a_struggling_worker_he_not_sure_about_raising_the_minimum_wage/"">2016 conversation with a low-wage worker</a> he dismissed the prospect of raising the minimum wage, echoing the talking points of the Canadian business lobby: “Maybe everything just gets more expensive or we have jobs leaving. We have to be very careful about that.” (A 2011 <a href=""http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/living-wage-policies-and-big-box-retail-how-a-higher-wage-standard-would-impact-walmart-workers-and-shoppers/"">University of California, Berkeley study</a> found the effects of raising the minimum wage on prices to be negligible at best. And the <a href=""https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/Manitoba_Pubs/mb_minwage_submission.pdf"">Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives</a> has argued that service sector jobs that tend to pay the minimum wage are by their very nature immobile, which suggests the threat of mass job flight is a myth.)</p> <p>Besides the obvious disjunctures between record and rhetoric, a closer scrutiny of Trudeau’s actual attitude towards economic inequality is perhaps even more instructive. In a 2013 article for the Globe and Mail, <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/justin-trudeau-why-its-vital-we-support-the-middle-class/article11209063/"">“Why it’s vital we support the middle class”</a>, he issued a warning to Canadian elites: </p> <p>“National business leaders and other wealthy Canadians should draw the following conclusion, and do so urgently. If we do not solve [the problems facing the middle class and low-income earners], Canadians will eventually withdraw their support for a growth agenda. We will all be worse off as a consequence.” Rising inequality, he said, could lead to “deepening divisions” such that Canadians might “begin to vote for leaders who offer comforting stories about who to blame for our problems, rather than how to solve them”.</p> <p>This is plainly the language of technocratic management, not moral urgency; first and foremost an appeal to the self-interest of elites rather than a coherent political demand directed at the powerful. In Trudeau’s war, it seems, inequality is a faceless and abstract enemy – a puzzle to be solved rather than an injustice to be stamped out. </p> <p>And while the prime minister calmly informs struggling workers that raising the minimum wage may have unintended consequences, the country’s wealthiest corporate executives get to keep their cushy tax advantages. The phony war rages on.</p>'}",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion

The man is a disaster for the planet | Bill McKibben</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That opposition has come from three main sources. First are many of Canada’s First Nations groups, who don’t want their land used for this purpose without their permission, and who fear the effects of oil spills on the oceans and forests they depend on. Second are the residents of Canada’s west coast, who don’t want hundreds of additional tankers plying the narrow inlets around Vancouver on the theory that eventually there’s going to be an oil spill. And third are climate scientists, who point out that even if Trudeau’s pipeline doesn’t spill oil into the ocean, it will spill carbon into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Lots of carbon: Trudeau told oil executives last year that “no country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there”. That’s apparently how much he plans to dig up and burn – and if he’s successful, the one half of 1% of the planet that is Canadian will have awarded to itself almost one-third of the remaining carbon budget between us and the 1.5 degree rise in temperature the planet drew as a red line in Paris. There’s no way of spinning the math that makes that okay – Canadians <em>already</em> emit more carbon per capita than Americans. Hell, than Saudi Arabians. </p> <p>Is this a clever financial decision that will somehow make Canada rich? Certainly not in the long run. Cleaning up the tar sands complex in Alberta – the biggest, ugliest scar on the surface of the earth – is already estimated to cost more than the total revenues generated by all the oil that’s come out of the ground. Meanwhile, when something goes wrong, Canada is now on the hook: when BP tarred the Gulf of Mexico, the US was at least able to exact billions of dollars in fines to help with the cleanup. Canada will get to sue itself.</p> <p>No, this is simply a scared prime minister playing politics. He’s worried about the reaction in Alberta if the pipe is not built, and so he has mortgaged his credibility. His predecessor, Stephen Harper, probably would not have dared try – the outcry from environmentalists and First Nations would have been too overwhelming. But Trudeau is banking on the fact that his liberal charm will soothe things over. Since he’s got Trump to point to – a true climate denier – maybe he’ll get away with it.</p> <p>But it seems like a bad bet to me. Faced with the same situation – a revolt over the Keystone XL pipeline – Barack Obama delayed for several years to avoid antagonizing either side. He ultimately decided he couldn’t defend the climate cost of building it, and so became the first world leader to explicitly reject a big piece of infrastructure on global warming grounds. Trudeau has made the exact opposite call, and now we’ll see if pipeline opponents cave. <br></p>  <figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday"">  <iframe src=""https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4162"" height=""52"" data-form-title=""Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email"" data-form-description=""Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening"" data-form-campaign-code=""US_opinion"" scrolling=""no"" seamless frameborder=""0"" class=""iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article"" data-form-success-desc=""We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening""></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was in Vancouver two weeks ago to help activists raise money for lawyers, and I would guess that the civil disobedience will continue – so far, two members of parliament have been arrested, an escalation we’ve never seen even in the States.

The showdown will be powerfully symbolic: kayaktivists, for instance, have paddled peacefully around the pipeline’s terminal, at least until Kinder Morgan put up an ugly razor wire barrier in the middle of the harbor.</p> <p>Now it’s Trudeau who owns the razor wire, Trudeau who has to battle his own people. All in the name of pouring more carbon into the air, so he can make the oil companies back at the Alberta end of his pipe a little more money.

The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, promised to do things differently than his predecessors. He promised indigenous peoples that our rights would be respected, and he has broken that promise, yet again. He promised us he would put pipeline expansion through a brand-new review, and instead the government is spending billions of dollars to buy it and, if necessary, complete and operate it over our objections.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Of the 117 indigenous groups who were a part of the consultation by the government, nearly two-thirds did not agree</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the way, the original pipeline carried 150,000 barrels of oil per day, which was primarily for domestic use. Today it carries 300,000 barrels, achieved by adding more pumping stations and pushing through more oil. So when the megapipe, with an estimated daily load of 800,000 barrels, is built, that capacity is only the beginning: it could double in capacity, with very little anyone could do about it.</p> <p>If this pipeline is completed, these pristine waters will become the sailing grounds for more than 21,000 huge oil tankers over the next 50 years, carrying the world’s most toxic oil – diluted bitumen – from the Alberta tar sands. That is the <em>minimum</em> number of oil tankers; it could be more. A single incident would render the beautiful beaches of the city, surrounding islands and Vancouver Island uninhabitable. It would kill the Salish Sea and destroy our Squamish territory. All it takes is just one incident – and no one, from industry experts to the government, can guarantee that won’t happen. </p> <p>Why risk it? We are told that “world-class” measures will be in place to prevent a spill and deal with one if it happens. A “world-class” standard for oil spill cleanup is that 10% to 15% is successfully recovered from the ocean. Of the remaining 85% to 90%, what doesn’t evaporate will destroy the beaches or sink to the bottom of the ocean to kill everything that now lives there, forever.

Can we trust governments, or a corporation, to have the best interests of Squamish people and the residents of our province and city at heart through that whole time? </p> <p>We know that financial constraints could make government or companies cut back on spill mitigation or prevention. In Canada we have seen cash-strapped governments close coast guard bases, lighthouses and weather stations, and allow search and rescue fleets and aircraft to age without being properly replaced. Governments cut back on oversight of all industries on a regular basis, only to express surprise when something goes wrong. And those are just the things we can control.

He told Canada’s indigenous people that our rights would be respected and upheld. He has broken that promise. He promised us he would put the pipeline expansion through a brand-new review. He has broken that promise as well. And this same government promises it will have our best interests in mind if the pipeline proceeds.

A First Nation has rights in their territory, but not in mine – and so free, prior, and informed consent is required in all indigenous territories. We’re also hearing from First Nations such as Upper Nicola and Yale First Nation that, while agreements are in place for their First Nation, it doesn’t equal enthusiastic consent for the project.

The bribery is alleged to have occurred between 2001 and 2011. If found guilty, the company would be barred from bidding on federal projects for a decade.

Wilson-Raybould declined to override the judgment of her top legal team.</p> \n<h2>What does the former attorney general say?</h2> \n<p>In searing testimony in front of parliament’s justice committee, Wilson-Raybould detailed “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/27/canada-trudeau-snc-lavalin-jody-wilson-raybould"">consistent and sustained” efforts</a> to change her mind. Despite repeated assertions by Wilson-Raybould that she would not bend, she told a justice committee on Wednesday the pressure intensified – and included “veiled threats” by aides that she was on course for a clash with the prime minister. She said that while it was proper for ministers and their staff to consult her about protecting jobs, it was inappropriate for her to make decisions based on “partisan political considerations”.

This enduring visual curiosity, secured by a well-placed SNC-Lavalin consultant, is a daily reminder of the company’s scandal-ridden recent past.</p> \n<p>It is perhaps why Québécois in Papineau and beyond are particularly wary of Trudeau’s relationship with SNC-Lavalin. “We were with him because of his father,” says Christos Manikis, editor of the Greek-language newspaper BHMA. “But he’s not his father yet, and when we look at how he handled the SNC case, we realize we can’t vote for him with closed eyes any more.”</p> \n<p>Still, even his rivals acknowledge Trudeau’s enduring ability as a politician. In 2015, Sasha Dyck campaigned in Papineau for the New Democratic party, which sits well to the left of Trudeau’s Liberals. Along with Lavscam, Dyck faults Trudeau for ignoring many of Papineau’s pressing housing needs. (More than one in three dwellings in the riding are cockroach- or rodent-infested, according to a 2011 city report.)</p> \n<p>Yet Dyck is under no illusions about an NDP victory in Trudeau’s domain. “He’ll win the next election,” says Dyck, somewhat begrudgingly. “People feel like he’s a good man, so it doesn’t really matter what he does.”</p>'}",False,pillar/news,News

He was clad in a lustrous red robe, the colour of the Liberal party, for which he was then a junior member of parliament. In the opposite corner, wearing Tory blue, was a young aboriginal leader and Conservative senator named Patrick Brazeau, who is a former navy reservist and a second-degree black belt in karate. Bookies had given the lanky Trudeau, a former high school teacher, three-to-one odds against.</p> <p>The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video"" title="""">televised match</a> was ostensibly a fundraiser for cancer research, but in Ottawa it became a sensation – a display of partisan pageantry rarely seen in the staid world of Canadian politics, where “bland works” had been the watchword of one long-serving provincial premier. The fight’s symbolism was lost on no one: in recent years, the Conservatives had battered the Liberals, turning a narrow lead in the 2006 election into a majority government by 2011. The Liberal party, which had governed Canada for much of the 20th century, had been reduced to a historically low number of seats.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/sep/09/justin-trudeau-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-political-brand-podcast"">Justin Trudeau: the rise and fall of a political brand – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trudeau ranked among the best hopes for resuscitating the Liberals and leading them back into power. But his political career, which began in earnest four years earlier, had been dogged by criticisms that he lacked substance and was riding on the coattails of his father, Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada’s longest-serving prime ministers. Barbra Streisand, a former lover of Pierre’s, once described him as a blend of “Marlon Brando and Napoleon”. In contrast, one critic had memorably dubbed Justin “the Paris Hilton of Canadian politics”. A triumphant bout in the ring could help erode this perception, Trudeau figured. “Never underestimate the power of symbols in today’s world,” he told a documentary film <a href=""https://vimeo.com/143909623"" title="""">crew chronicling the fight</a>.</p> <p>Within seconds of the opening bell, Brazeau pinned Trudeau against the ropes with an onslaught of heavy jabs. But the Conservative senator soon exhausted himself. Early in the second round, Trudeau seized on the opening, raining down blows on Brazeau. Less than a minute into the third round, as the Liberal MP continued to pummel his opponent, the referee halted the fight and declared Trudeau the winner.</p> <p>That victory was one of the first major triumphs in a branding campaign that helped to transform Trudeau from a politician widely derided as a lightweight into a global political superstar. “It wasn’t random,” Trudeau told Rolling Stone in 2017, referring to the boxing match. “I wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy, tough-guy senator from an Indigenous community … I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.”</p>       <figure class=""element element-video element--supporting"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video""            data-short-url=""https://gu.com/p/7v2n9""                    data-show-ads=""true""            data-video-id=""3722175""            data-video-name=""Justin Trudeau and Senator Patrick Brazeau face off in 2012 boxing match  – video""            data-video-provider=""LCN Canada""            > <video data-media-id=""gu-video-597a7d17e4b0cc197665c141"" class=""gu-video"" controls=""controls"" poster=""""> <source src=""https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/mp4""/><source src=""https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/m3u8""/><source src=""https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/webm""/> </video> <figcaption><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video"">Justin Trudeau and Senator Patrick Brazeau face off in 2012 boxing match</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the weeks after the fight, the Canadian media, which had previously portrayed the Liberal MP as a “reed-thin, pedigreed Dauphin”, began lauding Trudeau as a public figure of “toughness, strength, honour and courage”, noted Elise Maiolino, then a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Toronto, after analysing hundreds of news articles. That change in perception electrified Trudeau’s career, helping to set him on a path to become leader of the Liberal party the following year. Two years after that, in 2015, the Liberals made an unprecedented leap from third-party status to a majority government – and Trudeau became, like his father before him, the prime minister of Canada.</p> <p>The sort of potent spectacle that characterised his fight with Brazeau was, until recently, a hallmark of Trudeau’s tenure as prime minister. Like Barack Obama, Trudeau seemed to understand better than other politicians how to adapt the old ideas of political marketeering to the new realities of social media. He was a master of the viral video clip or poignant photo that seemed to express the worthiness of his government and the virtue of his politics. He became, as a flurry of academic research has put it, the first prime minister of the Instagram age. “I think he’s probably the best national leader since Ronald Reagan at projecting a certain image,” says Warren Kinsella, a former Liberal strategist.</p> <p>Trudeau has championed a vision of Canada as a nation friendly to allies, open to immigrants and just to its people. According to this image, Canada is a paragon of progressivism in an era marked by strains of authoritarian populism – as if crossing the border that separates Canada from Donald Trump’s US means travelling through a political looking-glass. And yet, Trudeau was never exactly anti-populist: he cultivated an impression that he both serves the masses and is adored by them.</p> <p>Ironically, but perhaps inevitably, Trudeau’s efforts to depict himself in this way have now helped to set the stage for his potential unmaking. Some of the policies enacted by Trudeau’s government have made his political identity seem hollow, even disingenuous. Compounding this has been the ongoing fallout from the most significant controversy of his tenure: Canada’s ethics watchdog recently found that Trudeau broke the country’s conflict of interest law in the hopes of allowing a giant engineering and construction firm to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/trudeau-broke-ethics-law-in-snc-lavalin-case-watchdog-rules"" title="""">avoid a corruption trial</a>. The company is facing charges in connection with millions of dollars in bribes allegedly paid to officials in Libya, including members of the Gaddafi regime, between 2001 and 2011.</p> <p>Far from the progressive, transparent government that Trudeau sold to Canadians and the global media, the scandal suggests that, like previous Canadian governments, Trudeau’s administration remains in thrall to the “Laurentian consensus” – the web of political, business and intellectual elites in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal whose collective name is a nod to eastern Canada’s mighty St Lawrence river. Ahead of a federal election in October, Trudeau’s approval ratings have plunged from a high of 65% in 2016 to about 32% in July, leaving him vulnerable to becoming the first Canadian prime minister since the 1930s to lose a bid for re-election after winning only one majority mandate.</p> <p>“Brand Trudeau was squeaky clean and fresh and new and a different kind of politics,” says Shachi Kurl, a pollster from the Angus Reid Institute. “And it’s turned out that Brand Trudeau is: ‘Welcome to the new politics, just like the old politics.’”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In an age of constant and intimate exposure to celebrities, it may seem unsurprising that the head of government of a country containing less than half of 1% of the world’s population should be so familiar. But how many other Canadian prime ministers have been profiled in the New York Times Magazine, Vogue and Rolling Stone? How many other Canadian prime ministers can most non-Canadians even name, let alone call to mind an image of? </p> <p>One of the extraordinary things about Trudeau is that he is famous in part because he is Canadian – a remarkably rare kind of fame. Most Canadians who are famous outside of the country have been processed through Hollywood or the US-dominated recording industry. Part of Trudeau’s appeal within Canada, then, is that he assuaged a dual sense of cultural insecurity and superiority, especially with regard to the country’s belligerent southern neighbour. (The majority of Canadians see Trudeau’s fame as a net benefit to the country, according to the Angus Reid Institute.) On the global stage he presented a sort of ideal form – likable, handsome, virtuous – in which the country could see its best self.</p>  <figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""Get the Guardian\'s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning"">  <iframe src=""https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read"" height=""52px"" data-form-title=""Sign up for The Long Read email” data-form-description=“Get the Guardian\'s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning” scrolling=""no"" seamless frameborder=""0"" class=""iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article"" data-form-success-desc=""Thanks for signing up""></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian’s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trudeau’s distinctly Canadian appeal goes even deeper. The prime minister represents a potent idea of Canada and what it means to the world. This idea is perhaps best summed up by a campaign motto of Trudeau’s father, from the late 1960s: “The just society.” The idea was sold to Canadians as encompassing the protection of civil rights, economic opportunity for all, scientific remedies to environmental problems, greater autonomy for Indigenous people in Canada, and a country in which the language rights of both French and English were enshrined.</p> <p>A great deal of Trudeau’s political cachet within Canada has been inherited from his father. Pierre is a towering figure in Canadian history, who liberalised laws on abortion and homosexuality, entrenched a charter of universal rights and instituted official bilingualism. The Canadian mass media guru Marshall McLuhan, a friendly adviser to Pierre throughout the 15 years he was prime minister, believed that Canada had no fixed identity, giving Pierre an opportunity to act as its “unifying image”. Canada could, in a sense, become what Pierre made it. Even if few Canadians subscribe to McLuhan’s view, it captures something central to how Pierre framed his own tenure as prime minister.</p>    <p>The craze for Justin Trudeau during the first years of his prime ministership echoed the “Trudeaumania” of his father’s ascent to power. Pierre, too, captured attention around the world by staging moments of spectacle – whether it was sliding down a bannister during his 1968 campaign for Liberal leader or pirouetting behind the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 1977. Pierre was “packaged and presented as a debonair anti-politician who drove sports cars and spent time with pretty women”, writes Alex Marland, a scholar of Canadian political branding at Memorial University. “To cultivate an image of a pop culture phenomenon” during Canada’s 1968 federal election, he adds, “Liberal strategists recruited young Liberal women to behave as obsessed fanatics” when Pierre was in the presence of reporters.</p> <p>Justin’s attempts to recreate Trudeaumania have involved wading through crowds to allow fans to snap selfies with him – while his official photographer <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B03zcs7AqZL/"" title="""">captures the moment</a> at a slight distance. The results, posted on Instagram, feel like a record of spontaneous adulation, but are actually tightly controlled. As Marland puts it, Trudeau is executing a “similar playbook” to his father’s, but “in different technological terrain”.</p> <p>Outside the country, Trudeau has played to the world’s eagerness to imagine Canada as a northern utopia untouched by the forces of nationalism and xenophobia. Within the country, however, there are many who think that Liberal Canada has never been the progressive place that Pierre and Justin tried to make it seem. The question now is whether voters believe his son has delivered more than just a good narrative.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When a political brand becomes as powerful as Trudeau’s has, it is tempting to read a person’s entire biography as a branding exercise. Things the politician did in their life before politics become plot points in a success story devised by a canny political operator. Ian Capstick, a political commentator who has worked for the Liberals as well as their rivals to the left, the New Democratic party, believes that Trudeau and his longtime friend and adviser Gerald Butts “have been carefully calculating every single entree of Mr Trudeau into Canadian public life for the past 30 years”. He adds: “There is not a single action that he took publicly that wasn’t considered, reconsidered and put out there in an attempt to eventually build the base that he would require to be prime minister.”</p> <p>Even if this view is a little too cynical, there is no doubt that living his entire life in the public eye has endowed Trudeau with an instinctive, if not infallible, sense of political optics. The beginning of his rise to power has usually been dated to 3 October 2000, when the 28-year-old delivered a dramatic televised eulogy at his father’s state funeral, closing with the words “Je t’aime, papa”, before resting his head on his father’s flag-draped coffin, his tears falling freely. Switchboards at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation lit up with more than 1,000 requests to replay the tribute.</p>    <p>Immediately, there was talk of the younger Trudeau entering politics, but many observers felt he lacked gravitas. He had spent his mid-20s drifting between stints as a bar bouncer and snowboard instructor before becoming a schoolteacher. He even admitted, or pretended, to an ignorance of current affairs. “I don’t read the newspapers, I don’t watch the news,” <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/justin-trudeau-like-his-peers-seeks-politics-without-politics/article1337650/"" title="""">he wrote</a> in the Globe and Mail the year after his father’s death. “I figure, if something important happens, someone will tell me.”</p> <p>Trudeau finally entered politics in 2007, when he began running for parliament in the riding of Papineau, a multicultural district in Montreal, which was represented at the time by a Quebec-nationalist party. During the election in 2008, he grasped something in miniature that Obama demonstrated on a larger scale that same year: that a political brand is not sufficient in and of itself – you also need a political operation. (Trump, who may not have had much of a grassroots campaign by comparison, is proof of how far such operations have moved to social media.) Trudeau won after mounting a year-long effort to knock on doors and shake hands in the district.</p> <p>It was an impressive start, but Trudeau’s subsequent four years as an MP were generally seen as insipid. It wasn’t until his rout of the Conservative senator Brazeau in the boxing match in 2012 that the larger political tide began to turn for him. Three years later, Trudeau’s fight to become prime minister made his father’s brand his own.</p> <p>In the 2015 general election, Trudeau married the values of the just society with the electoral approach pioneered by Obama, building the infrastructure for a grassroots effort while mounting an aggressive social media campaign. But Trudeau relied more heavily than Obama could on images. “Obama’s use of social media was, for lack of a better term, pre-visual,” says Tamara Small, a political science professor at Ontario’s University of Guelph.</p> <p>The election pitted Trudeau against Stephen Harper, a dour Conservative who had governed Canada for nearly a decade. Few expected much of Trudeau, the neophyte leader of Canada’s third-ranked party. “I think that if he comes on stage with his pants on, he will probably exceed expectations,” a Conservative spokesperson told reporters before the first debate. In one famous attack advert, Conservatives labelled Trudeau as “just not ready”, while mockingly conceding that he has “nice hair, though”.</p> <p>But many Canadians already felt a deep connection to Trudeau. “He has grown up in the public eye. He was literally born while his father was prime minister,” Marland told me. “He was a celebrity before he even became prime minister.” This made Trudeau seem regal, yet familiar – a brand you knew and could trust. Trudeau’s team did everything they could to encourage this intimate connection with their candidate. “It was probably Canada’s first celebrity politics federal election,” says Huguette Young, a veteran Ottawa journalist and author of Justin Trudeau: The Natural Heir. “They had Dinner with Justin, just like Dinner with Obama, and contests and you could win a date with Justin. He was almost commodified as a product.”</p>    <p>“Trudeau really built his brand in order to counter the brand of Harper,” says Vincent Raynauld, a professor at Boston’s Emerson College who studies Canadian politics. In contrast to his opponent, who was seen as icy and remote, Trudeau promised a return to “sunny ways” – the motto of a much-admired prime minister from the turn of the 20th century. While Harper mooted banning the niqab at Canadian citizenship ceremonies and launching a hotline to ferret out what his party called “barbaric cultural practices”, Trudeau made a passionate defence of multiculturalism and immigration.</p> <p>These were only two of the areas in which Trudeau promised to “do politics differently”. In a country where women make up just 26% of MPs, he promised to usher in a new age of gender equality – beginning by naming a cabinet comprised of as many women as men. In what would have constituted a direct challenge to his own party’s dominance, Trudeau pledged to make space for smaller political parties by reforming Canada’s first-past-the-post electoral system. He vowed to reset the country’s relationship with its disproportionately disadvantaged Indigenous peoples. All in all, the Liberal manifesto made 353 specific policy promises.</p> <p>After almost a decade of Harper, there was a widespread desire for change. Presented with two very different images of Canada’s future, voters responded with a clear answer. On 19 October 2015, the Liberal party swept back to power by picking up 148 seats on top of the 36 they already held in Canada’s 338-member parliament. It was the largest increase in seats in Canadian history.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As Trudeau took office, his focus on optics was on full display. The often sedate swearing-in of a new government was thrown open to the public and turned into a highly stage-managed, live-streamed event. Trudeau was due to arrive by coach at the prime minister’s official residence, 24 Sussex Drive, where he spent his childhood. (The house has been under renovation since Trudeau took office, and he and his family have been living in a 22-room guest house nearby.) To avoid any inelegant photos or video – “Getting off a bus is such an ugly shot,” Trudeau told his communications director that morning, in comments captured by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation – Trudeau’s team misled the media about where they should meet the new prime minister, ensuring that the first images the press got were of him strolling from 24 Sussex to the governor general’s official residence, Rideau Hall, where the ceremony would take place. At another point that morning, Trudeau and his team were preparing to respond to the question of why he was appointing a gender-balanced cabinet. “I think just calling people’s attention to the year is all you really need to say,” Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s right-hand man, told him. The advice yielded one of Trudeau’s most internationally famous lines: “Because it’s 2015.”</p> <p>Around the same time, Trudeau’s team was courting international attention, prioritising interviews with the New York Times and a sultry photoshoot for Vogue with his wife, Sophie, over interviews with Canadian media. “That was very, very deliberate,” said Susan Delacourt, a journalist at the Toronto Star. “There was a sense that Canadians would like that.” Many Canadians initially did, interpreting the attention as a sign of Trudeau’s place among progressive world leaders at a time when Obama was still president and Hillary Clinton seemed poised to succeed him, Delacourt added.</p> <p>Trudeau moved his official photographer into an office two doors down from his own. A mix of intimate and public photo ops – of the prime minister cuddling with pandas, greeting Syrian refugees as they landed on Canadian soil, throwing punches in a Brooklyn boxing gym – transformed Trudeau from a politician into a series of memes. During his first year in power, barely a week went by without some sort of viral moment from the prime minister that found its way into people’s daily lives as they scrolled through Snapchat on the bus or perused Instagram in bed. As Trudeau content appeared on social media shorn of context, it created new realities: a rehearsed <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/apr/16/justin-trudeau-and-quantum-computers"" title="""">explanation</a> of quantum computing became a show of Trudeau’s intellectual prowess; an innocuous cough on a visit to Washington DC became an example of Trudeau trolling the president.</p>    <p>A vital part of Trudeau’s brand was the contrast between him and the far-right politicians gaining ground around the world. In the US, Trump was on a journey that in some ways echoed Trudeau’s, parlaying his celebrity status into political power. When it came to optics, though, “Trump was a gift” for Trudeau, says Philippe Garneau, a corporate branding executive whose brother Marc ran against Trudeau for the Liberal leadership and is a minister in Trudeau’s cabinet. “I remember being worried. I said: ‘How can we put a man who has a degree in teaching and [who taught] drama, sit him down with Angela Merkel and across from Putin?’ And in walks Potus and upsets the whole apple cart,” Garneau went on. “So Trudeau got lucky. He was never shown to be the youngest, newest, greenest member at the table, but rather some sort of version of youthful exuberance, enthusiasm, optimism and a lack of cynicism.”</p> <p>When Trump pushed through his ban on travellers from a number of Muslim-majority countries, Trudeau tweeted that Canada would welcome those fleeing persecution, regardless of their faith. As accusations of sexual misconduct piled up against Trump, Trudeau proclaimed his own feminism in the pages of Marie Claire. As Trump vowed to put America first, Trudeau said Canada was “back” as a global player.</p> <p>Trudeau’s contrast with Trump was successfully memefied when the two leaders met in February 2017. Trump’s opening salvo with other world leaders had been an uncomfortably long, domineering handshake. Days earlier, Shinzō Abe, Japan’s prime minister, had been left reeling after a grip that dragged on for 19 seconds. Trudeau agonised for weeks about finding a technique that could show he was capable of holding his own, but which wouldn’t antagonise the man now at the helm of Canada’s largest trading partner.</p> <p>Eventually, he and his team decided on a combination handshake and shoulder grab. According to Politico, Trudeau and his senior aides spent part of their flight to Washington DC practising it. The rehearsal paid off: Trudeau was hailed around the world for the handshake <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/14/donald-trumps-strange-handshake-style-and-how-justin-trudeau-beat-it-video-explainer"" title="""">he unleashed</a> on Trump. Viral videos of the seconds-long power struggle overshadowed a visit in which Trudeau stood by silently – later telling reporters that it was not his place to lecture another country – as Trump unapologetically defended his controversial travel ban.</p> <p>It was part of a pattern in which Trudeau and his team produced globally viral images that starved important political issues of oxygen. In 2017, at the height of an opioid epidemic that had claimed a record number of overdose victims in Vancouver, Trudeau’s official photographer took an opportunistic photo of the prime minister running past a crowd of high schoolers on their prom night. Criticisms that the Trudeau government had not done enough to address the opioid crisis were buried by viral photos of the prime minister in running shorts and a T-shirt surrounded by students in suits and floor-length gowns. In politics, however, reality has a way of catching up with you. Eventually, the scandal, instead of the photo op, is what goes viral.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In retrospect, it seems predictable that a brand so well-devised, so symbolic and emotive, would encourage idealisations that in reality no politician could match. In 2018, some three years after Trudeau took power, cracks began showing in Trudeau’s glossy veneer. In February, Trudeau and his family made an eight-day visit to India that was described to me by his former foreign policy adviser, Roland Paris, as perhaps “the worst trip that a Canadian prime minister has ever taken abroad”. Although Trudeau sat down with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and attended a handful of other bilateral meetings, what gained traction on social media were photos of the prime minister flouncing around in traditional Indian outfits. The result was a trip that seemed heavy on Bhangra moves but light on official business.</p> <p>“India crystallised a lot of misgivings that liberals had that he was perhaps not as mature as we would like, he was not as prime ministerial as we would like, he was a little gimmicky and not taking it seriously with the world’s largest democracy,” Warren Kinsella, the former Liberal strategist, told me. Months later, Trudeau’s feminist credentials took a hit after an allegation resurfaced that he had groped a reporter at an event in 2000. While acknowledging that he did apologise at the time to the reporter after she confronted him, Trudeau <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/06/trudeau-i-apologised-at-once-to-reporter-behind-groping-claim-canada-2000-music-festival"" title="""">has said</a> he is confident that he did not act inappropriately. Criticism grew that Trudeau’s government was merely tinkering around the edges of change, masking their political inaction with a steady diet of unexpected moments and big talk.</p>    <p>“We’ve done check box, check box, check box,” says Celina Caesar-Chavannes, an MP and former parliamentary secretary to the prime minister who resigned from the Liberal caucus after a dispute with Trudeau. “But how does it really transform the lives of people who don’t have Trudeau’s privilege, who don’t have my privilege?” Caesar-Chavannes argues that Trudeau’s government has made small changes but consistently shies away from the bold, transformational work he promised in a campaign built around the slogan, “Real Change”. “I think there were some decisions around our ability to be re-elected as opposed to doing politics differently,” she says.</p> <p>Caesar-Chavannes gave me a number of examples of this sort of policymaking. Trudeau’s government legalised marijuana but rebuffed a call to expunge the records of those convicted of simple possession, even though prosecutions had disproportionately targeted people with low-incomes and Canadians of colour. Trudeau appointed a gender-balanced cabinet, but refused to reform the country’s electoral system, which would have paved the way for more female lawmakers. He promised a “total renewal” of Canada’s relationship with Indigenous communities, but his government has done little to address the mould-ridden housing and lack of clean drinking water that has left many Indigenous communities living in “Haiti at -40C”, as a politician from the New Democratic party has put it. After vowing to prioritise the fight against climate change and criticising Saudi Arabia’s treatment of human rights advocates, Trudeau’s government bought a C$4.5bn (£2.8bn) pipeline to better transport Alberta’s landlocked bitumen to international markets and signed off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh. And, after much of the international hype over its welcoming stance on refugees had died down, the government quietly introduced legislation this April that makes it harder for some migrants to seek asylum.</p> <p>Despite Trudeau selling himself as an open and transparent leader, several sources within the government described the centralisation of power in his office, with the prime minister’s inner circle playing the role of his gatekeepers. This is typical of highly branded politicians – the pressure to keep the whole government on message encourages top-down control – but Trudeau may have taken it to an extreme. Stéphane Dion served as Trudeau’s foreign minister for 14 months, and during that time he didn’t manage to land a single one-on-one meeting with the prime minister despite multiple requests, says Jocelyn Coulon, a former senior policy advisor to Dion. (Dion declined my request for a comment.)</p> <p>Trudeau’s supporters point to the ways in which he has lived up to his promises. Since 2015, more than 44,000 Syrian refugees have been settled in Canada, compared with the 2,300 that Stephen Harper’s government took in between 2013 and 2015. Trudeau’s tenure so far has seen 278,000 children lifted out of poverty, a feat credited to the country’s buoyant economy as well as a marquee child-benefit programme that provides direct funds to the country’s poorest families. The government raised taxes on the top 1%, while cutting income tax for those in the middle bracket. And, while Canada is expected to fall short of its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, Trudeau and his government have taken fledgling steps towards tackling climate change with legislation mandating a price on carbon in every province.</p>    <p>Perhaps Trudeau’s shortcomings wouldn’t have dominated public discussion in Canada for much of this year if a single large scandal hadn’t focused Canadians on the gap between Trudeau the brand and his actions while in government. In February, Trudeau was accused of trying to bully his justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, into helping SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering and construction company, avoid a corruption trial. Wilson-Raybould testified to a parliamentary committee earlier this year that Trudeau and his staff were worried that, if prosecuted, the company would move its head offices out of Montreal, potentially killing thousands of jobs and alienating voters in Quebec, home to a large number of strategically important parliamentary seats.</p> <p>Alongside the suggestion that Trudeau wanted to put his electoral success ahead of the integrity of the legal process, there was another layer to the scandal. Wilson-Raybould herself had once been a potent symbol of the Trudeau brand: she was the first Indigenous person and only the third woman to hold the post of justice minister. But the way she had been pressured by Trudeau and his team included “undeniable elements of misogyny”, she told the committee. Earlier this month, Canada’s ethics commissioner concluded Trudeau had violated the country’s ethics rules when he used his office to “circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit” Wilson-Raybould.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Canadians head to the polls in October, a central question will be whether Trudeau’s image is so badly tarnished that the Liberal party’s vision of Canada will seem less appealing, and less realistic, than the vision on offer by the parties to its right and left. As things stand, Trudeau’s main opponent is the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer. Scheer has vowed to roll back carbon taxes, opposed UN efforts to promote global cooperation on migration and wants to move Canada’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has also appointed a former board member of Rebel Media, a far-right website that has been described as Breitbart North, as his campaign manager.</p> <p>In order to hang on to votes in the diverse suburbs that ring Toronto, which have proven decisive in recent elections, Liberals have been highlighting Scheer’s divisiveness on issues of race and immigration. Trudeau has also drawn attention to the Conservative party’s poor record on the climate crisis, and there are signs that he will continue using Trump’s presidency to reinforce his own image as a champion of the just society. His government recently struck a deal with California to reduce vehicle emissions, while Trudeau has vocally criticised new restrictions on abortion access in a number of Republican-controlled US states.</p> <p>The prime minister is also trying to repair the damage done to his reputation by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and by the fact that he subsequently forced Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, out of the Liberal caucus. “We worked really hard to try and see if there wasn’t a way of continuing to move forward together,” Trudeau told the audience at a Liberal fundraiser in June.</p> <p>“That’s completely incompatible with facts,” Philpott told me. “Between 4 March when I resigned from cabinet and 2 April when I was booted out of caucus, I didn’t have a single conversation with the prime minister. And I had only one phone call from someone in his office.” She added: “There are times where the image and the narrative that the prime minister’s office wants to put out there is more important than accuracy.”</p> <p>Philpott likened this to another element of Trudeau’s brand that had rung false to her as a former cabinet member: “The whole listening to women, ‘diversity is our strength’, that kind of image,” she said. “And yet I didn’t feel listened to, and my diverse views didn’t feel like they had a place – those kinds of things were disappointing.” Philpott is planning on running as an independent in the October election, and said she now had a “lovely freedom” from the message control that had coloured all aspects of her job as a Liberal MP.</p> <p>Those behind Trudeau roundly reject the idea of the prime minister as a highly managed brand. “At the end of the day, he’s not a Nike sneaker,” says Kate Purchase, his executive director of communications and planning, whose responsibilities include vetting posts for his social media accounts. “He is a leader.”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/20/emmanuel-macron-orbiting-jupiter-emmanuel-carrere"">Orbiting Jupiter: my week with Emmanuel Macron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Purchase pointed to the issues Trudeau addresses, from the anxiety of the middle class to diversity and inclusion, to explain his meteoric rise on the world stage. “Those are things that many governments are struggling with,” she said. “People will always describe what they believe the brand to be, and what their version of the brand is, but at the end of the day, I think our brand is what we’ve delivered.”</p> <p>In recent weeks, polls suggest the Liberals have halted their plunge, and are slowly regaining some support. Still, an extraordinary challenge lies head for Trudeau and his team as they head into the October election, says the pollster Shachi Kurl. “How do you course-correct from something that is less about an event or a policy that people disagree with, and more about a broken brand?”</p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=""https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread"" title="""">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email"" title="""">here</a>.</p>'}",False,pillar/news,News

And as Canadians prepare for the mudslinging, a number of issues are expected to dominate the campaign.</p> <h2><strong>The </strong><strong>environment</strong></h2> <p>A spring of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/30/canada-flooding-quebec-montreal-justin-trudeau-climate-change"">intense flooding</a> in eastern parts of the country and wildfires raging in the west has brought new urgency to Canada’s response to the climate crisis.</p> <p>“For the first time in at least the last 10 years, the environment is actually coming out as the top, unprompted national issue of concern, said Nik Nanos, head of the Canadian polling firm Nanos Research. “[It’s] outstripping both jobs and the economy and healthcare, which are the two traditional issues.”</p> <p>In addition to a spate of natural disasters, Nanos credits a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/01/canada-carbon-tax-climate-change-provinces"">pitched battle</a> in the country over carbon taxes for keeping the environment as a key electoral issue.</p> <p>Trudeau is likely to position himself as the leader best equipped to meet the country’s climate obligations, despite the government being far off track for its Paris accord commitments.</p> <p>While the rival Conservative party has been widely panned for its lack of substantial environmental policies, Trudeau has also received vigorous pushback from climate activists.</p> <p>In late June, the government declared a climate emergency in the country – and then approved a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/18/canada-trans-mountain-pipeline-expansion-approved-trudeau"">multibillion-dollar oil pipeline expansion</a> the following day.</p> <p>“For the Trudeau government to approve this pipeline after declaring a climate emergency makes about as much sense as pouring gasoline on a burning fire,” said Greenpeace campaigner Mike Hudema.</p> <h2><strong>Populism</strong></h2> <p>Amid rising tides of far-right populism in the US and Europe, the election will mark the first country-wide appearance of the People’s Party of Canada – a rightwing splinter party led by the former Conservative minister Maxime Bernier. Ever since its formation, the party has railed against immigration and Canada’s multiculturalism policies.</p> <p>Like many countries, Canada has witnessed a growing intolerance for immigrants and racial minorities among conservative-identified voters, although analysts are unsure how much support a far-right populist party can expect. Bernier’s low polling numbers have so far disqualified him from the two leader’s debates held in October.</p> <p>The country’s electoral system typically rewards parties that cater to the centre, said Tamara Small, a political science professor at University of Guelph, where the plurality of votes are up for grabs.</p> <p>But analysts also see intolerance and xenophobia becoming increasingly concentrated in parties on the right. This recent shift speaks to a hardening of political views across all parties, said Frank Graves, president of the political polling company Ekos Research.</p> <p>“We’re seeing radical polarization on issues like climate change and … immigration in general,” said Graves. “We’re talking about stuff we’ve never seen before.”</p> <h2><strong>The Green </strong><strong>party</strong></h2> <p>The real beneficiaries of any populist wave could be the Green party, said Graves and Nanos.</p> <p>“The Greens, in my polling, are ahead of the [leftwing New Democratic party], which has never happened,” said Graves – signalling what could prove to be a fundamental reshaping of Canadian politics.</p> <p>If an election was held in the coming days, he said, “the Greens are very close to the point where they could be the power-broker that kept to a minority government in play.”</p> <p>Recent <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/09/canada-green-party-climate-change-federal-election"">electoral success</a> in local and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/prince-edward-island-elevates-green-party-to-opposition-in-canadian-first"">provincial elections</a> has buoyed support for the party and polling also suggests that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/16/elizabeth-may-canada-green-party-leader-election-profile"">Elizabeth May</a>, the Green leader – and most seasoned politician currently in federal politics – remains the most popular leader in the country.</p> <p>Much of the party’s appeal lies in its strong environmental stance, but also its position at the fringes of mainstream politics. Polling shows the Greens drawing support not just from disaffected Liberal voters, who feel the prime minister has not acted decisively on the environment, but also from the NDP – and even the Conservatives, said Graves.</p> <p>“It looks like the Green[s] … are Canada’s kind of ‘friendly response’ to populism,” said Nanos. “People that are dissatisfied or disenchanted with the system and are disappointed with the mainstream parties are now looking at the Greens as a protest vote against the system.”</p> <p>On Tuesday, 14 frustrated members of the NDP in the province of New Brunswick announced they would be leaving the party for the provincial and federal Greens.</p> <h2><strong>The </strong><strong>wild card</strong></h2> <p>In the summer of 2015, Trudeau was polling a distant third before the autumn election. Seemingly out of nowhere, he surged ahead and secured a robust parliamentary majority.</p> <p>While surprises could – and probably will – pop up domestically, Nanos predicts a major disruption could come south of the border, from the US president.</p> <p>“Donald Trump will probably say something that could materially shape the outcome of the election. It could be on purpose. It could be by accident,” said Nanos.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly broken with traditional taboos against commenting on foreign elections, weighing in on the UK Conservative leadership race and publicly supporting Benjamin Netanyahu’s re-election campaign as Israeli prime minister.</p> <p>Any barbs lobbed at Trudeau by the president could rally Canadians around the prime minister, said Nanos, and any endorsement of a Conservative candidate would probably be a “stake in the heart of the Conservative party”, he said.</p> <p>“Canadians are especially tuned into Donald Trump, whether they love or hate him because, realistically, Canada is hostage to geography.”</p> <p>The election is likely to be held on 21 October.</p>'}",False,pillar/news,News

Certainly not an afro-wig wearing, Banana Boat-singing, face-blacking one. Though, admittedly, he did do all those racist things and possibly more – it’s hard to know because <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/sep/19/justin-trudeau-says-he-doesnt-remember-how-many-times-he-wore-blackface-video"" title="""">he says he can’t remember</a>.</p> <p>If we know one thing about Trudeau, it’s that he loves people, all people. Especially “racialised Canadians”, as he now calls them, using the parlance of the day. Trudeau admires people of colour so much that when he found himself at a party dressed as Aladdin, he was happy to throw his arms around two genuinely racialised Canadians and grin boldly for the camera.</p> <p>Real racists don’t do that kind of thing, even in Canada, which, for all its progressiveness, can also be backward, especially in the highest circles of its cosmopolitan elite. Feel free to Google “the history of blackface in Quebec”, Trudeau’s prosperous home province, if you’re struggling to grasp how the 29-year-old son of a Liberal party prime minister thought it a hilarious idea to smear shoe polish on his face and, what’s more, for a party at the high school where he taught.</p> <p>Canada is an extraordinary country, but it isn’t the progressive utopia Trudeau wants it to be. Instead, it’s a decentralised collection of sparsely populated provinces and territories, a mosaic rather than a melting pot, as all good Canadian schoolchildren are taught.</p> <p>The country has long struggled to find a cohesive identity beyond its extreme climate and moderate aversion to conflict. Canadians are, for the most part, a nice lot, but as Trudeau showed us last week, niceness alone won’t save us.</p> <p>Trudeau can’t wish away the rising tide of populism that’s about to wash away his sunny ways any more than he can those dreadful pictures. But wishful thinking and shining intentions have long been Trudeau’s shtick and, when that fails, he loves a good apology. He’s such a fan of acknowledging past wrongs it’s become cultural policy. Every morning in many Canadian schools, children listen to an acknowledgment of the indigenous people on whose stolen land they are lucky to be standing.</p> <p>A good idea. But impoverished indigenous youth still <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/aug/30/our-society-is-broken-what-can-stop-canadas-first-nations-suicide-epidemic"" title="""">continue to kill themselves at an alarming rate</a> (there were huge demonstrations about the issue last week) and 50 communities are still living on “boil water” advisories. Trudeau’s working on the issue, he really is, but in the meantime lip service will have to do.</p> <p>In his <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/justin-trudeau-brownface-canada-pm-apologises-after-image-emerges"" title="""">contrition-fest of press conferences</a> last week, he acknowledged that he comes from “a place of privilege” and that it was this provenance that deluded him into thinking that blacking up was just goofing around. This admission, more than anything else, gets to the heart of why Canadian moderates are losing faith in the man who once delighted us by cuddling baby pandas and grooving it out with drag queens on Pride Day. There’s the feeling he’ll do anything to please an audience and consider the consequences later.</p> <p>In Trudeau’s words, it was only years later when he became an MP for a culturally and economically diverse Montreal constituency that he realised that blacking up was wrong. The press conference went on like this for several minutes – journalists tut-tutting, Trudeau displaying his vulnerabilities like a labrador rolling over for a tummy rub – until a reporter stuck it to him in the most politely Canadian way.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>It\'s great you\'re denouncing racism, but the prime minister\'s job was not created so you could work through your issues</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s great that you’re denouncing racism, the reporter said, “but the prime minister’s job was not created so you could work through your issues”. Then he plunged the blade deeper and twisted. “Maybe it’s time you realise that you are not the indispensable man.” </p> <p>For progressive Canadians, the concern about Trudeau was never that he was a power-mongering closet racist, just that he was a bit too soft for the job. This despite his former attorney general’s assertion that she was inappropriately pressured by his office – <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/02/canada-justin-trudeau-ex-attorney-general-scandal"" title="""">another badly handled scandal</a> that has hobbled him. </p> <p>Trudeau has only two modes: empathising and grovelling. Irrespective of his mystifying youthful makeup choices, neither mode has proved an effective weapon against the blandly malignant siren call of Tory rival Andrew Sheer’s populism. And that’s the real reason he’s failing. It’s not that we don’t believe he’s sincere – it’s that his sincerity has been revealed as a form of stupidity, a blindspot of privilege that undermines his project as a whole.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 27 September 2019 to clarify that many, but not all, Canadian schools have a policy of routinely acknowledging the relationship to the land of indigenous peoples.</p> <p><em>• Leah McLaren is a Canadian novelist and journalist</em></p>'}",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion

Trudeau’s leftwing posturing has been exposed as a sham. His widely hyped tax hike on the richest 1% was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/03/justin-trudeau-phony-war-against-inequality"" title="""">actually a giveaway</a> to the next richest 10% of Canadians. His embrace of a carbon tax became a cover for frenzied approval of fossil fuel projects, culminating in his purchase of a C$4.5bn (US$3.45bn) tar sands pipeline. He dispatched heavily armed police to violently dismantle a peaceful blockade of Indigenous land defenders. He made Canada the <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-now-the-second-biggest-arms-exporter-to-middle-east-data-show/article30459788/"" title="""">second largest weapons dealer</a> to the Middle East, arming the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/13/canadian-government-lied-over-12bn-arms-sale-to-saudi-arabia"" title="""">Saudi war on Yemen</a>. And he <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/trudeau-broke-ethics-law-in-snc-lavalin-case-watchdog-rules"" title="""">pressured his own justice minister</a> to exempt a well-connected and corrupt engineering giant from a criminal trial. Beholden to powerful vested interests, Trudeau promised big but delivered small.</p> \n<p>And so the energy he rode to power has evaporated. Trudeaumania, as one analyst put it, has been replaced by Trudeau-meh-nia. Now that the shine has worn off the Liberals’ formula of fake progressivism, we’re being treated to the party’s perennial fall-back: exhortations to back them “strategically”, lest the Conservatives come to power. Trudeau’s pledge to “do politics differently” has devolved into straightforward moral blackmail.</p> \n<p>Of course, it’s true that a government under Conservative leader Andrew Scheer would be a frightening ordeal: C$35bn (US$26.6bn) in <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/10/11/conservative-plan-would-cut-354b-to-balance-books.html"" title="""">spending cuts</a>, tax giveaways to the wealthiest, climate change denialism, and a potential erosion of abortion and LGBTQ rights. But the Liberals’ invocation of this rightwing threat is hardly in good faith. It’s something they have done time and again to muzzle the political imagination of Canada’s progressive majority of voters. Artificially shoring up the idea that the country is stuck between two parties has one main objective: scaring Canadians into settling for the pipeline-buying establishment Liberals.</p> \n<p>This fearmongering distracts from just how many economic policies Liberals share with Conservatives – corporate tax cuts, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2016/nov/22/justin-trudeaus-giant-corporate-giveaway"" title="""">creeping privatisation</a>, attacks on worker’s rights and relentless resource extraction on Indigenous peoples’ lands. The two parties’ implementation of this free market agenda has resulted in a wildly unequal social order: stagnating wages, unaffordable housing and skyrocketing corporate profits <a href=""https://pressprogress.ca/corporate-canadas-pile-of-cash-in-offshore-tax-havens-has-hit-353-billion-for-the-first-time-in-history/"" title="""">stashed away</a> in offshore tax havens. It’s no wonder that <a href=""https://globalnews.ca/news/5860959/canadians-society-politics-ipsos-poll/"" title="""">67% of Canadians</a>, according to a poll last month, believe correctly that the “economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful”.</p> \n<p>The Liberals’ inflated rhetoric against the Conservatives also disguises just how comfortable they are swapping power. They consistently propped up former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper’s minority government, though they could have toppled him by forming a coalition that included the social democratic New Democratic party (NDP). And when the NDP itself contended for office in the 2018 Ontario provincial election, the Liberals attacked it ferociously, enabling victory for the reactionary Conservative leader Doug Ford. Liberals have always been more afraid of a challenge from the left than the right.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> <gu-atom data-atom-id=""d9c7d9ef-0199-465c-a9fd-4e664cacfb09"" data-atom-type=""media""> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nv6tdsbOPKg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0""></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p> But if Canadians want the kind of country that reflects their progressive views, the choice in this election is clear: vote for the NDP. The overlooked story of the election is the surge in the party’s popularity, which has come at the expense of both the Liberals and Conservatives – and in spite of the media’s efforts to write it off.</p> \n<p>Under the leadership of Jagmeet Singh, the NDP has finally halted its right-ward slide – which allowed Justin Trudeau to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2015/oct/22/trudeaus-bold-change-pledge-was-a-ruse-but-canada-now-has-a-fighting-chance"" title="""">outflank</a> it to the left in 2015 – and is offering its <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-singh-health-policy-federal-election-1.5175899"" title="""">most progressive platform</a> in a generation. State-funded dental care and prescriptions, 300,000 green jobs and free public transit, paid for by a wealth tax on the ultra rich: the sort of the ambitious leftwing policies that polls consistently show Canadians are hungry for.</p> \n<p>In an age of turmoil, it is this kind of politics, rather than establishment Liberalism, that can hope to stem the tide of an increasingly xenophobic right. Pervasive insecurity and discontent in Canada, fundamentally unaddressed by Liberal policies, have been capitalised on by rightwing politicians to scapegoat migrants and Muslims – followed closely by openly white supremacist groups, whose numbers have <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/03/06/researchers-to-probe-canadas-evolving-far-right-movements.html"" title="""">nearly tripled</a> since Trudeau came to office. This week’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/16/obama-justin-trudeau-canada-election"" title="""">endorsement</a> of Trudeau by Barack Obama underscores the dynamic: both are defenders of a bankrupt, corporate-friendly centrism that has demonstrated it is no match for rightwing faux populists such as Donald Trump. This is what gives the ultimate lie to the promise of “strategic voting”. The politics of the Liberals aren’t a lesser evil – they are the surest path to greater evil.</p> \n<p>The only answer to a rising right will come from a left courageous enough to take on vested interests, rather than the vulnerable – and to redistribute obscene levels of private wealth in the service of the public good. The NDP is not going to win this election. But if Canadians elected enough of its MPs, a minority Liberal government might be forced to rely on the party to pass legislation: this would provide powerful leverage in parliament to push for vital new social programs and a transformative approach to the climate crisis, with social movements pressuring from the outside. Universal healthcare, public pensions, the 40-hour work week, same-sex marriage: all were won under previous minority Liberal governments when the NDP held the balance of power.</p> \n<p>But for that to become possible after Monday, it will take voting from hope, not fear. In this election, Justin Trudeau isn’t Canada’s real progressive choice – nor the politician to stop the rise of an ugly right.</p> \n<p>• Martin Lukacs is a journalist and author of The Trudeau Formula: Seduction and Betrayal in an Age of Discontent</p>'}",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion

They also announced the surprise cancellation of all spring break camps and urged residents to reconsider taking public transit.</p> <p>“The actions you take today will save lives,” Hajdu said. “This is a serious public health threat, and a crisis as well as an emergency.”</p> <p>Experts cautioned that no clear blueprints yet exist on now to stem the spread of the virus — but said that certain measures have shown degrees of success.</p> <p>“There’s no complete science behind any of it really — but it’s worthwhile to explore different ways of trying to control things,” said infectious disease specialist Dr. Susy Hota, medical director of prevention and control at Toronto’s university health network. </p> <p>“That’s where the social distancing makes sense to consider doing it early and trying to reduce the overall impact on everybody.”</p> <p>As the country prepares for an economic slowdown, driven by both the coronavirus and a plunge in oil prices, Trudeau said his government plans to green-light a wide-scale economic stimulus plan in the coming days.</p> <p>“We are in the enviable position of having significant fiscal firepower available,” he said.</p> <p>Alberta’s premier, Jason Kenny, has called on the federal government to announce a stimulus of at least C$20bn (US$14.3bn) – roughly 1% of the country’s gross domestic product – to offset the looming economic impact of the virus.</p> <p>“We need to design policies that will really help liquidity and cashflow for businesses that are uniquely affected right now,” he said on Thursday.</p> <p>The prime minister has not yet put a figure on the stimulus plan, but said the action will target Canadians who are most vulnerable to a downturn.</p> <p>“No one should have to worry about paying rent, buying groceries, or additional childcare because of Covid-19.

Erin O’Toole’s opposition Conservatives won 119, a result that largely mirrored the outcome of the 2019 election.</p> \n<p>“It looks like nobody wanted an election and no one got what they wanted,” said the Toronto Star political columnist Chantal Hébert as results came in.</p> \n<p>For <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/canada-elections-justin-trudeau-wins-narrow-victory-to-form-minority-government"">the second time in two years</a>, Trudeau has been handed a minority government by Canadians, meaning he will have to reach across the aisle to work with smaller parties in order to govern.</p> \n<p>In his victory speech at 1.15 in the morning, Trudeau nonetheless told supporters that Canadians had given him a “clear mandate” to continue governing – but acknowledged that his election gambit had not been popular.</p> \n<p>“I hear you when you say that you just want to get back to the things you love, not worry about this pandemic or about an election.

While Singh spent much of the election attacking Trudeau, at one point calling the prime minister an “abject failure”, Singh and his party are likely to support many of the Liberals’ policies as they try to push the government to the left.</p> \n<p>“You can be sure that we will be there for you, and you can also be sure that if we work together we can build a better society, and that’s exactly what New Democrats will do,” Singh told supporters on election night.</p> \n<p>O’Toole accused Trudeau of engineering a “quick power grab” after conceding defeat early on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>“Five weeks ago, Mr Trudeau asked for a majority. Tonight, Canadians did not give Mr Trudeau the majority mandate he wanted. In fact, Canadians sent him back with another minority at the cost of $600m,” the opposition leader said.</p> \n<p>While the opposition Conservatives led in the national popular vote, Monday’s result nonetheless marked a defeat for O’Toole. His centrist campaign failed to persuade enough voters to toss out the Liberal party after six years in power. The last time the Conservative party won an election federally was in 2011, raising broader questions about which direction the party could be pulled – and if O’Toole had the support of his caucus.</p> \n<p>“Our support has grown, it’s grown across the country, but clearly there is more work for us to do to earn the trust of Canadians,” O’Toole told supporters, while suggesting that he planned to stay on as leader. “My family and I are resolutely committed to continuing this journey for Canada.”</p> \n<p>The Green party leader, Annamie Paul, who has faced numerous challenges to her leadership in recent months, came in a disappointing fourth in her race in downtown Toronto. That result – and a collapse of Green support across the country – was unlikely to quell a wave of infighting which has beset the party.</p> \n<p>Maxime Bernier, the leader of the People’s party of Canada, which has run on a platform against public health measures like vaccines and masks, and which critics have called xenophobic and racist, failed to win his race, as did all of the candidates his party ran. While the party received far more support this election than in 2019, Bernier will once again face the challenge of leading a party with no representation in parliament.</p> \n<p>Elections <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada"">Canada</a>, which oversees the vote, had previously warned that some results would be delayed as mail-in ballots are counted.

Here is his story, abridged.</p> <h2><strong>The one where Justin Trudeau gets his head kicked in</strong></h2> <p>When Perry is nine months old, his father abandons his young family to go to California and chase his dreams of becoming an actor. As Perry puts it: “What the fuck is an actor? And where the fuck is my dad?”</p> <p>His mother starts working as a press aide to the Canadian prime minister, Pierre Trudeau (Justin’s dad), remarries and moves briefly to Toronto, when 10-year-old Perry starts acting up, smoking, getting bad grades and even beating up young Justin Trudeau (“I decided to end my argument with him when he was put in charge of an entire army”).</p> <h2><strong>Could he </strong><em><strong>be </strong></em><strong>any better at tennis?</strong></h2> <p>As a teenager, Perry discovers that he has three talents: acting, tennis (he is nationally ranked in Canada by age 14) and drinking.</p> <p>He and two friends have developed their own distinct cadence, like “Could we <em>be</em> more in detention?” (“Chandler Bing changed the way that America spoke …” Perry suggests. “Only I got rich off it, though.”)</p> <p>On another fateful night, Perry has his first drink: a bottle of Andrès Baby Duck, described today as a “sweet, purple, sparkling wine”.</p> <p>As his friends throw up around him, Perry finds himself at peace for the first time. “I was lying back in the grass and the mud, looking at the moon, surrounded by fresh puke, and … nothing bothered me.”</p> <h2><strong>Goodbye tennis, hello acting</strong></h2> <p>Age 15, already a “broken human being”, Perry moves to Hollywood, hoping to reconnect with his father. This causes a great rift with his mother, and when the California heat proves too great a shock for a Canadian tennis prodigy, Perry switches his career goal to acting. Even at his lowest, he has always thrilled to be the class clown, the lead in the school play: “Why wouldn’t I want to pretend to be another person?”</p> <p>Perry likewise follows his father further into alcoholism, drinking six vodka tonics every night and declaring them the “best part of his day”. The difference is, Perry Sr is high-functioning (and eventually gets sober by taking a long walk, his son notes resentfully).</p> <h2><strong>Keanu Reeves is no River Phoenix</strong></h2>    <p>At 15, Perry has no trouble performing for a crowd. California women love his Canadian accent and the quick patter, sarcastic humour and double-takes for which he will eventually become famous.</p> <p>One day a man spots him in a diner, “charming a bunch of young women”, and drops him a note asking him to be in his next movie.</p> <p>The man transpires to be William Richert, and the film is A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon, starring River Phoenix. They become firm friends and seven years later, he is mourning Phoenix’s death at the Viper Room.</p> <p>“It always seems to be the really talented guys who go down,” muses Perry. “Why is it that the original thinkers like River Phoenix and Heath Ledger die, but Keanu Reeves still walks among us?” (Perry has since apologised, and said he picked a name at random.)</p> <h2><strong>Princess Leah’s rhyming half-sister</strong></h2> <p>At 18, Perry starts dating Tricia Fisher – Carrie’s half-sister. “The rhyming poetry of her name alone should have made her irresistible”, but Perry is concealing something from her: drinking-related (although he doesn’t realise this yet) impotence. He disguises it, “like a great ugly secret”.</p> <p>The charming Fisher manages to whisper an erection out of him for just long enough to lose his virginity. How does Perry repay her? “Why, good reader … by sleeping with almost every woman in southern California.”</p> <h2><strong>Chandler Bing – via Boston Legal</strong></h2>    <p>By age 24, Perry has had a few roles and is desperate to be famous. He’s drinking not just with his similarly striving buddies – including The Simpsons’ Hank Azaria and Craig Bierko, later of Boston Legal – but alone, too.</p> <p>When the script for a buzzed-about new show called Friends Like Us comes his way, Perry is instantly struck by the “world-weary yet witty view of life” of one character in particular. “It wasn’t that I thought I could <em>play</em> ‘Chandler’, I <em>was</em> Chandler.”</p> <p>The problem is, Perry is already committed to another show: a “sci-fi comedy” about baggage handlers at LAX in the year 2194. It was even worse than it sounds, says Perry.</p> <p>Bierko gets offered the part of Chandler, and – though crushed – Perry nonetheless advises him to take it. Bierko turns it down.</p> <p>Then, on another fateful night, an NBC producer – chatting in bed with her husband, a Fox TV producer – learns that the “awful” baggage handler show has been canned and Perry is available. Within a week, he is cast as Chandler.</p> <h2><strong>Jennifer Aniston is definitely not interested</strong></h2> <p>From the very first table read for Friends, Perry recalls electricity in the air – and money, and fame.</p> <p>All six stars are not only young and attractive but genuinely funny. Perry is pitching 10 jokes a day, not just for Chandler but for every character, and every day two get used. Courteney Cox is the only established name in the cast, having starred in Ace Ventura and Family Ties, but she stresses: it is going to be an ensemble show.</p> <p>Perry’s historic crush on Jennifer Aniston – whom he had asked out and been rebuffed by three years prior – disappears in “the hot glow of the show … and her deafening lack of interest”.</p> <h2><strong>Sexy faxes with Julia Roberts</strong></h2>    <p>As Friends quickly becomes huge, Perry finds that the success he prayed for is not without pressure.</p> <p>He has appeared on Letterman and Rolling Stone; he is receiving million-dollar movie offers; Julia Roberts, the biggest star in the universe, has agreed to appear in Friends on the condition that she appears in Perry’s storyline.</p> <p>“But how to woo her?” Perry wonders.</p> <p>He sends Roberts three dozen red roses with a card: “The only thing more exciting than the prospect of you doing the show is that I finally have an excuse to send you flowers.”</p> <p>For some reason, Roberts replies challenging him to explain quantum physics to her. Perry writes her a “paper about wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle and entanglement”. Roberts responds by sending Perry “lots and lots of bagels”.</p> <p>Their courtship progresses to daily faxes. It is not unusual for Perry to leave a party early to race home to his fax machine, and to read each “captivating” missive four or even five times. This continues for three months (and about two feet of paper). Eventually, “Julia’s fax veered romantic”.</p> <p>They date for a while before Perry, racked with anxiety about getting dumped, breaks up with Roberts first. “I can’t begin to describe the look of confusion on her face.”</p> <h2><strong>Jet skis: never a good idea</strong></h2> <p>While shooting Fools Rush In with Salma Hayek (who “always had a very elaborate and lengthy idea about how to do a scene”), Perry has a jet ski accident and is given a Vicodin pill for the pain.</p> <p>He takes it while driving his red Mustang convertible home to Las Vegas: “I shook hands with God that morning.”</p> <p>Having survived the drive, he gets 40 more pills delivered to his house. Within 18 months, he is taking 55 a day. It is a “full-time job” just to secure them, and Perry is shooting the third season of Friends plus the Christopher Guest movie Almost Heroes.</p> <p>He is not eating, and drinking and vomiting “constantly – behind trees, behind rocks, in ladies’ rooms”. “No one knew – not my family, my friends, no one. I was impossibly sick all the time.”</p> <p>At 26, Perry goes to rehab.</p>    <h2><strong>The Friends cast role play penguins</strong></h2> <p>Rehab kicks Perry’s Vicodin addiction, but not the drinking, which persists until 2001.</p> <p>Aged 30, just before signing on for seasons six and seven of Friends – the deal that, at David Schwimmer’s suggestion, secured the cast more than $1m per episode, each – Perry is hospitalised with pancreatitis. He carries on drinking, and starts on methadone – on top of the Xanax and cocaine.</p> <p>Aniston comes to his trailer to confront him: “I know you’re drinking … We can smell it.” One day at a table read, the medication combines with the alcohol so disastrously, no one can understand what Perry is saying.</p> <p>“In nature, when a penguin is injured, the other penguins group around it and prop it up until it’s better,” he says. “This is what my co-stars on Friends did for me.”</p>    <p>Perry moves to Dallas to shoot a film, Serving Sara, but finds he is too unwell to go ahead. He is later sued for the movie’s shutdown, costing him $650,000: “Small price to save my life.”</p> <p>He is still living in a treatment centre in Malibu when Monica and Chandler get married in May 2001.</p> <p>When Friends tapes its final episode, three years later, the cast, crew and audience is in tears and Perry feels nothing. “I couldn’t tell if that was because of the opioid I was taking, or if I was just generally dead inside.”</p> <h2><strong>Genuinely traumatic medical consequences</strong></h2> <p>After hitting rock bottom and having a religious experience in his kitchen, Perry manages to go without alcohol for periods of up to two years. He has a six-year relationship, and several shorter ones.</p> <p>In July 2019, Perry awakes from a two-week coma: his colon has exploded due to opiate abuse. He has to carry a colostomy bag for nine months. “The next time you think about OxyContin,” his therapist tells him, “I want you to think about living out the rest of your days with a colostomy bag.” Perry quits.</p> <p>Smoking proves harder, even when his doctor tells him that he will be dead by 60 if he doesn’t stop now – even when he starts seeing a hypnotist and manages to quit for 15 days.</p> <p>One day, when Perry bites into a piece of toast with peanut butter, his front teeth fall out. The pain sends him straight back to cigarettes.</p> <p>The struggle is ongoing: in January this year, Perry had his 14th surgery pertaining to opiate abuse. He does not believe he has slept more than four hours in his whole life. He is single, and filled with regret about past relationships. “This is the life of someone who’s been blessed with the big terrible thing,” writes Perry.</p> <p>And yet – concludes Perry, now 53, writing from his rented home overlooking the Pacific Ocean, with a Diet Coke in his glass and a pack of Marlboros in his pocket – “at this point in my life, the words of gratitude pour out of me because I should be dead, and yet somehow I am not”.</p> <ul> <li><p>Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing by Matthew Perry (Headline Publishing Group, £25).

They are one of those signatories to the constitution and the rest of us, as signatories to the constitution, have a right to exercise our sovereign powers in our own areas of jurisdiction.”</p> <p>The bill sets the stage for Alberta to possibly ignore federal laws or regulations if it determines those laws are harmful to the province’s interest or if deemed a constitutional overreach.</p> <p>Critics of the bill, including constitutional scholars, have previously warned that a law that directs provincial bodies such as schools, municipalities and city police to disregard federal laws will open the door to a wave of court challenges and is probably unconstitutional.</p> <p>The province’s lieutenant governor, Salma Lakhani, had previously said she needed to carefully review the bill before granting assent, and would act as a “constitutional fire extinguisher” if needed.</p> <p>Smith has also faced criticism from within her own party on the law, which conservatives worry will scare off investors and businesses.</p> <p>The New Democratic party leader, Rachel Notley, condemned the bill as “horrible, anti-democratic legislation” and pledged to scrap it if her party wins the provincial election in May.</p> <p>Indigenous leaders have also criticized Alberta’s legislation, as well as a similar bill that recently passed in Saskatchewan.</p> <p>“We will not stand idly by. We will not allow it to happen,” the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, RoseAnne Archibald, said on Wednesday.</p> <p>The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, Treaty Six and Treaty Seven chiefs say the “sovereignty act” infringes on their treaty rights and that any amendments to the bill aren’t enough for them to support the law.</p> <p>Rick Wilson, Alberta’s Indigenous relations minister, told reporters that the new law respects treaty rights, but that the term “sovereignty” had caused confusion among Indigenous leaders.</p> <p>“In fairness, there’s not a lot of clarification around what that means. Should we have done more consultation? Absolutely,” he said.</p> <p>Trudeau has previously declined to comment on the content of the bill, telling reporters his government isn’t “looking for a fight” with Smith.</p> <p>“I’m not going to take anything off the table, but I’m also not looking for a fight.
